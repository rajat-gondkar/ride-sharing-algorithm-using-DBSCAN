# Dynamic Ride-Sharing Simulator

A sophisticated React-based simulation platform that demonstrates advanced algorithms for optimizing urban ride-sharing services. This project combines **DBSCAN clustering** and **genetic algorithms** to create efficient vehicle-to-passenger matching systems that minimize travel distances and maximize ride-sharing opportunities.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Dynamic Ride-Sharing Simulator addresses the complex challenge of matching multiple passengers with available vehicles in real-time, considering spatial proximity, time constraints, and vehicle capacity. The system simulates realistic urban scenarios where passengers request rides from various locations, and the algorithm determines optimal groupings and vehicle assignments.

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Clustering**: Groups nearby passengers using DBSCAN algorithm
- **Genetic Optimization**: Uses evolutionary algorithms for optimal vehicle matching
- **Real-time Visualization**: Interactive map showing clusters, routes, and vehicles
- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics for efficiency analysis
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable simulation settings for different scenarios
- **Realistic Data Generation**: Creates clustered passenger patterns with noise

## üß† Algorithm Details

### 1. DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm

**Purpose**: Groups passengers who are spatially and temporally close enough to share a ride.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Epsilon (Œµ)**: Distance threshold (default: 0.5 km) - maximum distance between cluster points
- **MinPts**: Minimum points required to form a cluster (default: 2 passengers)
- **Distance Metric**: Euclidean distance between passenger pickup locations
- **Noise Handling**: Isolated passengers outside clusters are handled separately

**Algorithm Flow**:
1. Randomly select unvisited points as potential cluster seeds
2. Expand clusters by finding all points within Œµ distance
3. Continue expansion recursively for each neighbor
4. Mark remaining unvisited points as noise

**Benefits**:
- Automatically determines optimal number of clusters
- Handles irregular cluster shapes
- Identifies outliers (noise passengers)
- Scales efficiently with large datasets

### 2. Genetic Algorithm for Vehicle Matching

**Purpose**: Optimizes vehicle-to-cluster assignments to minimize total travel distance and maximize efficiency.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Population Size**: 50 individuals per generation
- **Generations**: 100 iterations for convergence
- **Selection**: Tournament selection with size 3
- **Crossover**: Single-point crossover with 0.8 probability
- **Mutation**: Random gene mutation with 0.1 probability
- **Fitness Function**: Minimizes total distance while respecting constraints

### 3. Routing Algorithm

**Current Implementation**: Straight-line routing for simplicity
- Calculates direct distances between pickup and dropoff points
- Considers detour limits for passenger satisfaction
- Optimizes for total vehicle travel distance

**Future Enhancements**:
- Integration with real road network data
- Traffic-aware routing
- Time-based route optimization

- **Cluster Formation**: Number and size of passenger clusters created
- **Vehicle Utilization**: How efficiently vehicles are used

### 2. Distance Optimization
- **Total Distance Saved**: Reduction in travel distance through ride-sharing
- **Average Detour**: Additional distance passengers travel due to sharing
- **Vehicle Route Length**: Total distance each vehicle travels

### 3. Time Efficiency
- **Average Wait Time**: Time passengers wait for vehicle pickup
- **Service Time**: Total time from request to dropoff
- **Processing Time**: Algorithm execution time
